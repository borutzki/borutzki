Python & Robot Framework Witch Doctor 🐍🤖🧙

_(at least colleagues at work used to call me that)_

At work I do the following: 
- code new features for Netbox-based Django App 🐍
- implement unit tests by first making the code testable, then testing it ✅,
- refactor existing code and try to apply some design patterns to it 🧹,
- constantly try to improve developer experience (linters, reviews, devcontainers and so on) 🥷

and my skillset also allows me to do the following:
- write magical wrappers for obscure APIs 🪄,
- automate end-to-end tests with Robot Framework 🤖,
- setup GitLab CI and automate boring stuff with some DevOps techniques ⚙️
- configure and improve Docker containers 🐳


I like coding with some weird electronic or whatever else music playing in the background (Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, I look at you!). Other than music, I like books (technical ones too), gym and writing blogs (in polish only, at least at a time of writing this). 

Feel free to contact me on [GitHub](https://github.com/borutzki/borutzki), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@borutzki) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kacperborucki/) if you look for new Python specialist employee or support on your Python project! I can't promise I'll take it but if you don't ask, I definitely won't!
