Python & Robot Framework Witch Doctor, lvl. 27 🐍🤖🧙

_(at least some student at work calls me that)_

At work I do the following: 
- test automation 🤖,
- unit tests ✅,
- writing magical wrappers for obscure APIs 🪄,
- code refactoring 🧹,
- noise 🎛️ _(hopefully not much)_.

I like coding to some weird electronic or whatever else music comes to my mind or Spotify playlist. Other than music, I like books (technical ones too), gym and writing blogs (in polish only, at least when I write this). 

Feel free to contact me on GitHub, Mastodon and LinkedIn!
